### Checkfile.sh
This Bash script is a straightforward utility designed to help users determine whether a given input path corresponds to a file, or a directory, or if neither is present at the specified location. Upon execution, the script prompts the user to enter a path, and based on the detection, it provides a brief message indicating whether it's a directory, a file, or if neither exists. It's a handy tool for quickly identifying the type of path you're dealing with in a Unix-like environment.

### Zip.sh: 
This Bash script provides a simple menu-based interface for zipping files and directories. It uses the gzip and tar commands to compress files and folders. Users can choose between zipping a file or a directory by selecting the appropriate option. After compression, the script displays the details of the zipped file or directory using stat. It's a straightforward tool for creating compressed archives in Linux environments. You can run the script by executing it in a terminal, and it will guide you through the zipping process.
